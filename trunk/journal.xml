        <title>Ice</title>
        <content>Roman is an Ice user. He can only make ice form in his hands, though supposedly he should be able to freeze water in the air just by concentrating. Maybe he should train more.</content>

        <title>T: Vegan Majin?</title>
        <content>Roman doesn't eat flesh or anything that comes from animals, such as honey or eggs. That's pretty weird for a Majin.</content>

        <title>Old Kitchen Servant</title>
        <content>Roman used to be a servant in a kitchen back when he lived in Russia. He ran away when he found out that the meat he was cooking came from Majin that were no longer useful. That's also why he chose to become a vegan.</content>

        <title>T: Plants!</title>
        <content>Soume is a plant user. He talks to them and is able to grow them from seeds in his hands. He can even collect pollen. No one knows the full potential of his power.</content>

        <title>T: Lactose Intolerant!</title>
        <content>Soume tried to eat some of Riku's strawberry shortcake and seemed to have some...stomach problems. He's probably allergic to dairy products.</content>
      </entry>


      <entry id="012">
        <title>T: What does he eat?!</title>
        <content>Soume drinks a lot of water, but have you ever, ever seen him eat? Roman gets an answer from him, finally. He eats very sparingly, and rarely, because the only thing his stomach can tolerate is fresh, live meat. </content>
      </entry>


      <entry id="013">
        <title>Childhood Suffering</title>
        <content>As a child, Soume suffered the worst experiences that anyone could imagine. He was abused emotionally, physically, and sexually by humans who wanted to break him. It explains a lot of his personality...</content>

        <title>T: Are Plants Aware?</title>
        <content>Soume is always talking to his plants, and unlike other plants, they MOVE to look at him sometimes! Are plants smarter than we think they are, or is that just Soume's special ability? He does create monster plants that listen to his commands... </content>

        <title>Traitor</title>
        <content>The family that Susa saved Soume from, the Akemiya, still had a hold over Soume these last 20 years. He's been working as a double agent...and he succeeded. The rescue has been destroyed, and countless killed. </content>

        <title>Former Hunter</title>
        <content>Susa is the oldest daughter of the Kamiya family, one of the families that runs the Church of the Acts. She was raised to hunt Majin and has killed countless numbers of them. She was first in line to be the head of the family, but left when she realized the true extent of the pain she was causing, using her knowledge to save Majin instead. Soume was one of the first she saved, at least 20 years ago. </content>

        <content>Susa has a little brother, but she never mentions him. Her son, SonNameHere, was lost in the ambush Susa did 20 years ago in which Soume was rescued. That loss seems to be the reason Liza and her aren't together anymore. </content>
