        <title>The Basics</title>
        <content>Midorikawa Riku is a 17 year old kid who attends BlahBlah High School. He dislikes sitting still, and rarely does any homework, but his amazing memory allows him to do well on tests as long as he pays any attention. He is the school's sports star and MVP in track, soccer, and football. </content>

        <title>Dark Fire</title>
        <content>Riku's ability manifests as a dark fire that seems able to spread from his entire body. It burns very fiercely, and is hard for Riku to control.</content>

        <title>Disability?</title>
        <content>Riku seems to have a slight issue with paying attention for too long. Is that because he's a Majin, or might it be something else?</content>

        <title>Ice</title>
        <content>Roman is an Ice user. He can only make ice form in his hands, though supposedly he should be able to freeze water in the air just by concentrating. Maybe he should train more.</content>

 <entry id="006">
        <title>Vegan Majin?</title>
        <content>Roman doesn't eat flesh or anything that comes from animals, such as honey or eggs. That's pretty weird for a Majin.</content>
      </entry>

 <entry id="007">
        <title>Old Kitchen Servant</title>
        <content>Roman used to be a servant in a kitchen back when he lived in Russia. He ran away when he found out that the meat he was cooking came from Majin that were no longer useful. That's also why he chose to become a vegan.</content>

        <title>Effeminate!</title>
        <content>Soume is rather feminine, even though he's a man. It might not be the usual, but Soume seems very comfortable with himself just the way he is, so it's no big deal.</content>

        <title>Plants!</title>
        <content>Soume is a plant user. He talks to them and is able to grow them from seeds in his hands. He can even collect pollen. No one knows the full potential of his power.</content>

        <title>Lactose Intolerant!</title>
        <content>Soume tried to eat some of Riku's strawberry shortcake and seemed to have some...stomach problems. He's probably allergic to dairy products.</content>
      </entry>


      <entry id="012">
        <title>What does he eat?!</title>
        <content>Soume drinks a lot of water, but have you ever, ever seen him eat? Roman gets an answer from him, finally. He eats very sparingly, and rarely, because the only thing his stomach can tolerate is fresh, live meat. </content>
      </entry>


      <entry id="013">
        <title>Childhood Suffering</title>

        <title>Are Plants Aware?</title>
        <content>Soume is always talking to his plants, and unlike other plants, they MOVE to look at him sometimes! Are plants smarter than we think they are, or is that just Soume's special ability? He does create monster plants that listen to his commands... </content>

        <title>Traitor</title>
        <content>The family that Susa saved Soume from, the Akemiya, still had a hold over Soume these last 20 years. He's been working as a double agent...and he succeeded. The rescue has been destroyed, and countless killed. </content>

      <entry id="082">
        <title>Anorexia</title>
        <content>Soume is incredibly thin, and looks somewhat ill. He's never seen eating, everyone has only seen him drink water. Soume seems to have some sort of moral dilemma eating humans, since he was enslaved by them for so long. But he still manages to be really powerful...I hope he's okay.</content>

        <title>Former Hunter</title>
        <content>Susa is the oldest daughter of the Kamiya family, one of the families that runs the Church of the Acts. She was raised to hunt Majin and has killed countless numbers of them. She was first in line to be the head of the family, but left when she realized the true extent of the pain she was causing, using her knowledge to save Majin instead. Soume was one of the first she saved, at least 20 years ago. </content>

        <content>Susa has a little brother, but she never mentions him. Her son, SonNameHere, was lost in the ambush Susa did 20 years ago in which Soume was rescued. That loss seems to be the reason Liza and her aren't together anymore. </content>

        <title>Doctor</title>
        <content>Osamu Kazutaka is the only known Majin doctor. He has numerous PhDs and an MD for humans, but I guess he went into his secret specialty a long time ago. I wonder how he got credentials as a Majin doctor when there aren't that many of us and most people don't even know we exist.</content>

        <title>Self-Hatred</title>

        <title>Problems with Soume</title>
        <content>Soume and Doctor Osamu have never gotten along. Even though Soume's really nice, I think it's pretty odd that he doesn't like someone even a little. But years ago, when Soume was still a slave, Doctor Osamu did an experiment on him to test his healing abilities and removed his...parts. I don't think I'd be able to forgive someone after that either. </content>

        <title>Basic Biology</title>
        <content>Majin are a group of language-capable, sentient beings who are genetically different from humans. While exact biology depends on species, Majin generally have sharp teeth and a set of heart valves where a human would have a heart. Majin are broken into a few types: animal-type, humanoid-normal type, and humanoid-elemental type. Animal types are known for brute force and physical power. Humanoid-normal types appear human and have decent strength in addition to non-elemental based abilities, such as shapeshifting and sensory powers. Humanoid-elemental types also appear human, have decent strength, but have specific element-related abilities.</content>

        <title>Flame Users</title>
        <content>Flame users are Majin who have the ability to call the Fire element, and part of the group of elemental Majin. Their body temperatures are naturally higher than both humans and other Majin. Experienced users can launch fire from any part of their body, and heat up the very air</content>
      </entry>

      <entry id="045">
        <title>Eating Habits</title>
        <content>Majin are largely carnivorous as a group, feeding off all sorts of meats, including other Majin outside their specific Majin species, non-verbal animals that humans eat, and of course, humans themselves. All Majin require some meat in their diet to be at full health. Some types of Majin can survive, though weakly, on no meat, while others will starve without it. The amount of non-meat product, and how rare it must be, depends on the species.</content>

      <entry id="046">
        <title>Youko</title>
        <content>Youko are fox-like Majin, one of the few species groups that is both an animal-type and an elemental-type Majin. Needs more elaboration. </content>
      </entry>

      <entry id="047">
        <title>Ice Users</title>
        <content>Ice users are elemental Majin who have control over ice. The opposite of fire users, their body temperatures usually are colder than other Majin as well as humans. Experienced users can freeze the water in a person's body, killing them. </content>
      </entry>

      <entry id="048">
        <title>Puberty</title>
        <content>Puberty for Majin is much longer than a human's. Early childhood is considered between ages 1-15, and between 17-20 is the onset of puberty. It then lasts about 50-80 years, and a Majin is considered an adult on their 100th birthday.</content>
      </entry>

      <entry id="049">
        <title>Eating Habits 2</title>

        <title>Ogres</title>
        <content>Ogre Majin are an odd mix of the animal-type and humanoid-normal type Majin groups. They are extremely large and tend to weigh a lot; their main skill being in brute strength. Some pass for human, while others are significantly more monster-like. A rare few inherit humanoid-normal abilities. </content>

      <entry id="053">
        <title>Sensors</title>

	<entry id="054">
        <title>Low Intelligence...</title>
        <content>Majin, on average, seem to have lower intelligence than humans, though the Majin who live in the temple don't seem any different from humans in general. Is there a reason for that? Maybe it's not intelligence they're low on...maybe they're just different from humans because they're a completely different species.</content>

        <title>Ferality</title>
