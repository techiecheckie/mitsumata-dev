    r "Ugh...I don't know why I even tried."
    
    "I am terrible at telling stories.  I'll fucking admit it."  
    "Still though, at least Roman or Soume could pretend to act scared.  Roman is too busy disecting the logic of it all and Soume wouldn't be frightened unless my story involved a weed whacker."
    
    su "What're you all doing out so late.  Should be getting to bed.  Especially you, sprog."
    r "Right, I was just-"
    ro "Riku was just telling us about the appauling state of our prison system."
    r "No!  It was just supposed to be a scary story, is all!"
    su "Aw, really?  I love a good scary story.  Which one was it?"
    r "The one with the escaped convict with a hook for a hand."
    su "That shitty old story? Fuck, no wonder they look bored, kid.  You gotta do a better job than that."
    r "But that's the only one I know.  And I thought it was pretty good..."
    su "Nah.  But, here, I'll tell you a good one.  A true one, actually.  One involving this very rescue."
    r "Oh yeah?  Does it end with you jumping at me and yelling 'IT IS RIGHT BEHIND YOU!'"
    su "What, no.  No one would be stupid enough to fall for-RIKU WATCH OUT!"
    r "AH!"
    "I turn around to where she is pointing, only to see Soume sitting there twirling his fingers around in the cool grass.  He looks up at me and waves enthusiastically."
    s "Hi Riku!"
    r "Uh...yeah.  Hi."
    su "Ha ha ha!  I can't believe that actually worked.  Anyway, as I was saying, I don't think I ever told you this before sprog, but someone died here."
    r "Here?  Like where I'm sitting?"
    su "No, dunce.  I mean here, like here at the rescue."
    r "Really?  Someone died?"
    
    "I'm not sure if I should take here seriously or not."  
    "Roman and Soume are talking to each other about something, so apparently they've already heard this or know Susa is just messing with me.  I can't tell which yet."
    
    su "Yup.  Before I got here though.  Long time ago.  The last person that ran this place didn't really take a hands on approach.  Just sort of let you guys take care of yourselves."
    r "Sounds better than-"
    su "You sayin' something, kid?"
    r "Ah...no.  Just commenting that, uh...nothing.  I'll ask later."
    su "Hmph.  So, some of the Majin would end up training themselves.  Others just spend the entire day playing around and relaxing around the rescue."
    r "Any chance we could start that up again?"
    su "No.  And stop fuckin' interrupting.  Now one day a group of young Majin were playing upstairs."  
    su "They were playing hide-and-seek.  One of the children decided to hide inside an old antique trunk, but when he climbed inside, the trunk closed on him."
    s "Oh no!"
    
    "Soume is finally paying attention again.  Sort of.  Right after he yelled that, he starts looking around at his plants again."
    
    su "The other children searched for hours, but couldn't find him.  It wasn't until days later that they found him in the trunk, but by then it was too late.  There was nothing they could do."
    su "Well, that was the end of things, at least for a while."  
    su "But later, people started noticing some weird things.  Items went missing."  
    su "People would feel chills when passing by the room he trapped himself in.  And then...people started seeing him again.  Glimpses, but people kept on seeing him."
    
    r "Sure.  And why don't people still see him then?  Hmph.  Nice try."
    
    su "Heh.  Who says they don't?  Come with me kiddo."
    
    "She stands up and walks towards a particularly dense portion of trees by Soume's garden."  
    "I look over at Roman and Soume.  Roman is smiling at me and motions for me to follow her.  I get closer to the trees and look around."
    
    r "What am I supposed to be looking for?"
    su "Just peak back through here, sprog."
    
    "I look around pass the trees she's pointing at.  Nothing.  Can't believe I almost believed her."
    r "Hmph.  Nice try, but-OH WHAT THE HELL?"
    
    "I see it.  There is just a flicker, but a shadow of a girl flickers in front of my eyes.  She looks happy, but a little confused.  She reaches towards me, but fades out before she can finish the motion."
    
    r "Ghosts!  There are ghosts here?  THIS PLACE IS HAUNTED?"
    
    "I begin thinking of the quickest ways to pack up all my stuff, but Susa starts laughing."
    
    r "What?  What're you laughing at."
    su "Sorry, sorry.  Didn't mean to frighten you.  That much at least.  Those weren't ghosts."
    r "Huh?  Then what were they?  I...I definitely saw her.  She was just in front of me."
    su "Yeah, those aren't ghosts though.  They pop up here every once in a while, but all of that is just brief glimpses of Majin on the other side of the barrier."
    r "Oh...that...is strange.  How do they get here?"
    su "Fuck, I dunno.  They seem to show up in places wherever there are a lot of Majin, but beyond that I don't know.  Glad they do show up though; makes it easier to scare all the new students."
    r "I-I wasn't scared."
    su "Mm hmm...why don't you head back with Roman and Soume.  I have some stuff I need to finish up anyway."
    "She turns and heads back towards her office.  She is smiling a bit, which is a nice change of pace, but I think it might have something to do with how loud I yelled when she showed me the 'ghost'."

    su "Oh Liza...this is amazing.  I...I don't even know what to say.  I'm just so...happy."
    l "I agree.  I almost couldn't believe it.  We will need to plan this carefully.  If this is where I think it is, he might still be under Akemiya control."

    l "Excellent.  Glad you came around."

    su "I could send some people from the rescue down to check the area out."

    l "Tempting, but still no.  I'll need you when we go to rescue him, but I can move more freely on my own.  Nothing against your powers, Susa, but I have a bit of an advantage."
    su "Well, I guess the abillity to transform into an any probably would be useful at some point when you're trying to sneak around in the forest."
    l "Oh, it certainly does.  It has made it remarkably simple to spy on the Akemiya house, and to move in and out at my whim."
    su "Hmph.  So you're saying I'd just get into your way during the recon?  I dunno...I'm telling ya, it might be better to have both of us there."
    l "No, Susa, I really must insist.  That will only increase our chances of being seen.  It is for the best if I do this alone.  My shapeshifting abilites will make the task quite simple solo."
    su "But what if something happens to you Liza?  We can't risk something bad happening fuckin' now.  We are so damn close."

    su "Ehhhhh...fine.  I guess.  But you better come back soon.  And in one fuckin' piece."
    l "Susa, you have nothing to worry about.  I have handled more capable foes than this."  
    l "I expect this area to be even less heavily guarded than their main compound.  Well, perhaps for a few scattered scientists, but that is to be expected."
    su "Yeah, I guess.  Wait, what?  Why would scientists be out in the middle of the forest?"

    l "It never said that directly.  RIght now, I am working under the assumption that he is fine, and at worst he might be slightly altered physically by this experimentation."
    su "Fuck.  Fuck, Liza, I should come with.  We should go now, we need to-"

    m "Hmm...I don't want to ruin the surprise.  But, ask yourselves this."
    m "I've been watching up here.  I knew you would show up.  I've had the jump on you.  I could have easily killed you, if I wanted to."
    m "And yet...here you are.  Here you stand.  Now...why would I let you two live?"  
    m "Perhaps...perhaps living would be worse?  Perhaps once you find out what happened, you would wish for death.  And you know how I am loathe to give you what you desire."
    su "...you."
    m "Ah yes.  The lightbulb has finally been lit!  Still rather dim, but at least it is something."
    m "That's right.  I haven't killed you because it is unnecessary."
