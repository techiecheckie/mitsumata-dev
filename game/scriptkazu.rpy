    "I could go check on the doctor. He was the most shaken up."  
    "Seeing him freak out...well, it's good to know I wasn't the only one."

    k  "Yes?  Who is it?"
    
    r  "Uh…it’s me.  Riku."
    
    k  "Riku?"
    
    "He pauses for a second.  I can’t tell if he doesn’t know if he should let me in or if he just doesn’t remember my name."
    
    k  "Ah, yes.  Hold on."
    
    #play sound  Unlocking noise.
    
    k  "Come in.  You will excuse me for the current state of my lab.  I wasn’t expecting company.  A little bit of warning would be appreciated in the future."
    
    "Current state of his lab? It’s dirty as usual!"
    
    r "Uh...it’s no problem."
    
    k "Good timing at any rate. I have been working on this new strain of bacteria and I thought you might be interested..."
    
    r "...no thanks. Can you work with...bacteria and talk at the same time?"
    
    k "Child, I am a scientist. I’m quite the expert at multitasking.  In the past, I have performed surgery on two separate individuals at once because neither could wait."
    
    r "Oh.  …cool, I guess."
    
    k  "Hn. I suppose I can’t expect you to describe such a novel achievement without resorting to frivilous adolescent language such as that."  
    k "This bacteria is rather vicious, you see.  I mean, I can handle it, of course, but you being a novice and rather inexperienced in matters such as this…I would worry about you."
    
    r  "Greeeeeeat. So, what makes it so bad?  Gives you the flu, or something?"
    
    k "Hm…I guess you could put it that way.  The only major difference is…well, you know how the flu dehydrates your body and makes your head rather congested?"
    
    r  "Yeah."
    
    k "Well, this little critter takes your insides and your outsides, and reverses their relative position."
    
    r  "…how is that remotely the same?  And why are you studying it?"
    
    k "It is absolutely fascinating, I know, I completely agree with you.  I only just discovered it last year after it infected one of my patients."  
    
    "He walks over and points to a Petri dish behind a glass enclosure."
    
    k "Here is the culture, if you’re curious. Just look at the size of the colonies!  Have you seen anything like this before?"
        
    #Riku mutters to himself.
    r "Like I'd wanna see something like that--"
    
    k  "Kazutaka coli."
    
    r "Excuse me?"
    
    k "The name of it. It is undiscovered you see, so I get to name it!  So far it seems unique to Majin, so humans haven’t had a chance to classify it."
    k "Of course...I'd love to test it on a human..."
    
    r "Creeeeepy. So, anyway-"
    
    k "It'll be a whole new genus, you see!  Nothing like this has been seen before.  So, naturally, I named the genus after myself."  
    
    r "You discovered a bug that is capable of killing Majin, and you decided to name it after yourself?"
    
    k "Of course!  Perhaps a little vain, now that I think about it, but I think I deserve a little bit of self indulgence!" 
    k "And, of course, you realize species name 'coli' already, coming from Latin and meaning 'of the colon.'"
    
    r  "Yeah…of course.  We covered that in my 'Latin you’ll never need to use' course."
    
    k  "So, what do you say, Riku?  Care to help me grow it?"
    
    r  "‘Scuse me?"
    
    k  "Miss Susa, you see, she’s been on me to start training an apprentice.  What with me being the only Majin doctor, she believes I need to start passing on some of my knowledge."
    
    r "I don't think I'm a good choice..."
    r "Not really in the mood to be playing with something that would like to rearrange my insides."
    
    k "Oh, Riku, please.  This is rather simple.   So simple even a child like yourself should have no problems."
    
    r "But I like my body parts where they are."
    
    k  "It is perfectly safe! The bacteria will be behind this glass hood at all times! All you need to do is replate the bacteria."  
    k "I fear they are rather delicate outside of their natural habitat, so this is a more arduous process than it typically is."
    
    "How do I get roped into these things?"
    
    r "I guess I can do it."
    
    k "Excellent!  I knew you were the man for the job, Riku.  I could see it in you; you’ve always taken a special interest in my work!"
        
    r "Yeah.  You know me.  Woo science, and all that."
    
    k "I’ll be over at my desk.  Just inform me when you are finished or if you manage to contaminate yourself so I can alert the morgue."  
    
    r "WAIT!  Hold on, you need to show me what I’m doing here.  I don’t know what to do with this."
    
    k "Oh, I had assumed that would be obvious Riku.  Don’t you see the tools in front of you?"
    
    r  "Uh…yeah.  So?"
    
    k "Ah, well, I guess I better explain it to you."

    #Minigame!  Help Doctor Kazutaka regrow his cells.  His cells need heat to grow.  Be sure to apply heat when a colony shaped like (whatever shape) shows up.  
    #However, be wary; other bacterial strains can also grow.  Be sure to apply cold to them when they do or they will use up all of the nutrients.
    
    #Failure:
    k  "No no no no no!  My bacteria!  You’re killing them Riku."
    
    r "This is harder than I thought it would be."
    
    k "Hmph.  You are quite lucky I have more stock we can use.  Be careful this time!"
    
    r "Sure thing.  Sorry Doc, I know I can do it this time."
    
    #Success:
    k "Brilliant, simply brilliant, Riku!" 
    k "Of course, I could have done the same task in a fraction of the time.  And these colonies are much smaller than the ones I am capable of growing.  They don’t seem as viable, either..."
    
    r "Look fine to me."
    
    k "To the untrained eye, perhaps.  Trust me though, these colonies are quite substandard when compared to my typical work."
    
    "Even his damn compliments sound like insults.  Have to admit, helping him wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be.  And at least he doesn’t always roll his eyes when he talks to me anymore."
    
    r "I should get back up.  Thanks though."
    
    k "I am always happy to help those who are in the pursuit of knowledge, Riku.  You are welcome back at any time."
    
    r "Great.  Oh, uh, you know, I think we’re heading out to the city tomorrow."
    
    "Doctor Osamu stops smiling and his old frown returns to his face."
    
    k  "'We'?  Who is 'we'?"
    
    r "Uh, well, me, of course.  And then Roman.  And maybe Soume."
    
    "Doctor Osamu clicks his tongue loudly and waves his hand, as if to dismiss me."
    
    k "I certainly cannot stop you from associating with trash and traitors, but I would rather spend the day alone in my lab, thank you."
    
    r "You sure? Soume isn’t so bad, once you get to know him."
    
    k "I know him quite well. Better than you, I would expect.  And I know he’s up to something.  Do not trust him, Riku."
    
    "There is an urgency to his voice. I don’t know what happened between him and Soume, but whatever it was is enough to make him fucking paranoid.  He almost jumps whenever I say his name."
    
    r "You keep on telling me that, but he seems like an ok guy to me, you know?"
    
    k "You are still young.  You're at least a hundred years too early to have developed a keen sense of character, and the ability to see that in others.  It will come in time."
    
    r "Riiiiight."  
    
    k "It is his fault, you know?"
    
    r "What exactly is that?"
    
    k "Those plants he uses...they blocked my sensory capacities. That's how we were ambushed."
    
    r "…you don’t think Mamoru is a more likely candidate?  The evil guy trying to eat all of us.  Soume included."
    
    k "HA, as if that Mamoru actually considers Soume to be on his menu."  
    
    r "Well, do you have evidence that it was Soume?"
    
    k "I…well, that is…nothing tangible, mind you.  But I know it’s him!"
    
    r "Look, just cheer up some.  It wasn’t your fault that we got ambushed.  You don’t need to look for someone to blame."
    
    k "I’m not-"
    
    r "Here."
    
    "I take out the plant Roman gave me earlier.  I put it on his desk, and he eyes it.  He prods it with the end of his pencil and looks back up at me."
    
    k "What’s this?"
    
    r "What’s that?  Are you sure you’re a scientist?  That there is a plant.  And a gift."
    
    "He looks back down at it.  He looks confused, like he’s never received either of those things before in his life."
    
    r "Keep it, water it, do all that sort of stuff."  
    r "Just...remember that you aren’t alone here. We all have your back.  Even Soume.  Whether you want to recognize it or not."

    k "..."   
    
    r "Hey, Doc?"
    
    #Kazutaka mutters
    k "Hmm…no.  Certainly not an extremophile.  But maybe if…no, that can’t work.  But then how else?  Oh.  OH!  Ah, how silly of me."

    ro "But what about Soume? He knows so much about healing already..."
    
    k "Soume?  Ha!  Do you let the wolves tend to the sheep as well?  I am quite adept at taking care of myself.  Let us just leave it at that."

    ro "Oh...but--but that's BESIDES the point, and it's that Soume is an amazing healer--"
    
    k "Hmph.  Mere parlor tricks.  I have no time for his shamanism or his alternative medicine.  I am a doctor; I have no need for voodoo."

    ro "The smell?"
    
    k "Oh, don’t tell me you haven’t noticed. It has gotten so strong that even you must have a hard time ignoring its call now."

    #Kazutaka chuckles, darkly.
    k "Oho...come now, Roman. You don't know what that particular smell comes from? Truly?"
    
    ro "With all due respect, Doctor Osamu, I try my best to avoid meat.  I hold my breath when I pass the kitchen."
    
    k "Oh, that’s right. I forgot you were a vegan. I can’t even imagine how your mind rationalizes Soume’s eating habits."
    
    ro "Well, lots of people eat meat, Doctor Osamu. I suspect that is a ham sandwich you’re carrying right now."
    
    "Whatever he's getting at, I know I won't like it."
    
    k "Yes, this is ham, but the pigs can't--wait.  Wait just a moment, Roman."

    ro "Yes, he has been...slightly more grating than usual. I imagine he blames himself for the ambush."
    
    s "Oh, is that so? It doesn’t sound like the Doctor to blame himself for anything."
    
    ro "Well, outwardly, no.  But you can tell it is eating at him.  He seems to be going off at the slightest provocation.  You know what he complained about today?"
    
    s "Roman, I think it would be quicker if I just guessed what he didn’t complain about today."
    
    ro "True!  Today he complained about the smell of the meat!"
    
    s  "…the meat?"
    s "..."
    
    ro "Yes! I couldn’t believe it. He went on about how terrible the scent has grown!  He singled out you specifically.  He informed me that he wanted me to talk to you about it!"
    
    s "Ah. He said that?"
    
    ro "Don’t worry, Soume, I’m not going to lecture you about it.  I think the good Doctor is just looking for something to vent about these days.  Take his complaints with a grain of salt."
    
    s  "Yes. Of course. Did…did he say anything else to you?"
    
    ro "Nothing much of importance."
    
    "Soume seems genuinely hurt by Doctor Osamu’s comments.  Now I sort of wish I hadn’t even told him.  I never considered he would take this so seriously."  
    
    ro "Soume, honestly don’t trouble yourself over it.  I haven’t noticed any difference in the odor, and you know how detestable I find meat."

    ro "I'm sure I'd be the first to know."
    
    s "Well..."

    "I used to be a kitchen slave for a wealthy family in Russia. What happened to me...it's not something I talk about."
    "But I want to tell Soume. I want Soume to understand me, and maybe...let me in a little bit."
    "And he was in captivity himself...we have so much in common!"
    "Am I just being hopeful?"
    
    s  "Oh?"
    
    ro "I...used to be a servant. For humans."

    ro "That's where I learned to cook. Me and the guys in the kitchen...we thought we had the best job."

    ro "All of us were Majin, but unlike the others, we got to stay in warm kitchen to sleep. I didn't need it much, since my specialty is the cold, but..."

    ro "We all thought we were so blessed."
    
    "I clear my throat.  All those terrible memories are starting to come back."
    
    ro "As long as we cooked the meals on time, no one bothered us."
    
    s "...go on."
    
    ro "Then one guy I didn't know very well disappeared. Then another."
    ro "Then another."
    
    ro "And all the while...I didn't even think about all the meat that was coming into the kitchen."
    
    ro "The first thing I cooked in that kitchen was the boy I was replacing."
    ro "But I couldn't tell...he just looked like...like red meat."
    
    ro "I must've cooked my cell mates. My friends. The missing kitchen staff..."
    
    "I was almost shaking now.  I couldn’t stop though.  If Soume was ever going to know me, he had to know this."
    
    ro "Until finally, one day, I caught them. My last close friend in the kitchen. They killed him. All that meat I'd been eating...it was...all of it was..."

    ro "It WAS. How could I have been so stupid...I was EATING my own--"
    
    ro "But I was terrified. We all were.  I didn’t want to die.  Does that make me a terrible person?  I cooked everything they wanted without thinking." 
    ro "Children. Friends. Pregnant mothers."
    
    ro "When I was the only one left...I ran before they could get me, in the dead of winter. It's so thankful that I have an immunity to the cold and humans don't, or they might have come after me."
    ro "But can I ever redeem myself for those people that I...prepared for humans to eat?"
    
    s "..."
    s "...oh Roman."

    s "But right now...you're here, with me, and safe."

    ro  "A-ah--thank you for listening. To my story. To---um--"
    
    "Soume nods. He is looking at me with an expression I can’t quite place."  
    
    s "And because of those things...that is why you no longer eat meat."
    
    "I’m taken a little aback. I have to admit, of all the things he was going to say, that was one I didn't expect."
    
    ro "Ah. Yes. That is when I stopped eating meat. No one should be someone else’s food. Living creatures are destined for so much more than that."  
    "Majin, cow, pig, human, everyone.  There is no reason why we must dine on other living things."
    "It's worse when that thing can beg for mercy."
    
    s "And yet...you dine on plants, do you not?  Vegetables?"
    
    ro "Yes…but that is different."
    
    s "Different how?  Are plants not alive?  They can certainly feel pain, I can assure you of that."
    
    ro "…"
    
    s  "And the pigs and the cows that you refuse to touch, each day they ravage the land, eating their weight in flowers and grass and plants of all kinds."
    
    ro "Soume..."
    
    "I don’t know what to say. Soume...seems upset." 
    "I never really thought about this before, but he is remarkably close to plants.  He always talks to them. Do my eating habits hurt him?"
    
    ro "But one must eat…something."
    
    s "That is true enough."
    
    "He stares at me a little while longer.  He looks as if he’s thinking about something, but not quite comfortable vocalizing it."
    
    s "You do know, Roman, that Majin are largely meat-eaters. Some can only stomach the primest of meat. Human or other Majin."
    
    ro "Yes, I've...heard of them."
    
    s "And what is your opinion of them?"
    
    ro "No one should be anyone else's food. I can't change my opinion on that."
    
    "The look Soume is giving me now...he's never given me it before. I think I've really messed up."
    "His voice is steady, but brimming with terseness."
    
    s "Even if they have no other choices?"

    m  "No.  That is what I thought.  I mean, the doctor is still over there right?  How could the answer really be otherwise?"

    na  "Ngh…can’t…breath…"

    #Naomi is still choking.
    
    na  "NO!  NOOOOO!"
    
    "Electricity starts to crackle out of the ends of Mamoru’s fingers.  I begin to smell the scent of something burning, and before long, I notice that scent is coming from Naomi."  
    "She is trying to scream, but nothing is coming out.  Her face contorts in agony and her hands claw desperately and Mamoru’s fist."
    
    "Right as her kicks start to slow, Mamoru turns to the nearest tree and slams Naomi’s body headfirst into the thickest part of the trunk.  She spasms one last time, then falls motionless."

    m  "Right, now where were we?"
    
    ro  "I-I…"
    
    "The three of us just stare at Mamoru for a while.  He is smiling at us, like he just told us the punchline of a joke and was waiting for a response."
    
    m  "Oh, come now.  No need to be so tense.  I truly am sorry for that bit of unpleasantness.  You must believe me what I tell you I did not wish you to see that."
    
    m  "Good help is just so hard to find, you know?  Finding someone you can trust, and depend on.  Ugh.  I hope you three don’t let that little thing sour the mood."
    
    "I try to think of something to say, but nothing comes to mind.  It would be like trying to talk to a tornado, or trying to reason with an earthquake."
    
    m  "Ah, yes, that’s right.  Kazutaka, now come with me.  Roman, Riku, you two may return to the rescue.  For now."
    
    "He smiles at us.  Opens his mouth wide, and I can see what looks like dried blood on this teeth."
    
    ro  "N-No.  We won’t let you take him."
    
    m  "Hm?  Can you repeat that one more time?"
    
    "Roman is shaking.  He doesn’t even look like he’s believing what he’s saying.  He eventually steadies himself again, and manages to make eye contact with Mamoru.  He draws up an ice sword."
    
    ro  "No, you can’t-URK."
    
    "Before Roman can even draw up his sword, Mamoru closes in on him and breaks it with his bare hands.  He then lifts Roman up using the same hand he did on Naomi."
    
    m  "Oh heh heh heh.  It looks like I’m going to be much busier than I thought today.  See, I had secretly hoped you would put up some resistance."
    
    r  "Roman!"
    
    m  "Stay put, boy!  In fact, if you wish to see tomorrow, this is when you should start running.  Not you, Doctor!  Heh, thought you could slip away."
    
    "Again, lighting starts coming from his fingers, and Roman starts to sizzle.  He slams Roman on the ground."  
    "Hard.  He manages to gurgle something, but his words are incomprehensible.  I want to move…but I can’t.  I’m frozen to the ground."
    
    "Mamoru lifts Roman high up, and slams him back into the ground."
    
    ro  "EHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
    
    "This time, I hear something crack.  His left leg is bent backwards, and it looks like it got caught at a weird position against his back as it was coming down."  
    "Tears are streaming down his face, which mix with the blood coming from his nose and mouth and drip slowly to the ground."
    
    m  "Still kicking, huh?  Wow, tougher than I gave you credit for.  I thought one would get the job done.  Two, at the absolute most.  Well, how about we give it another go?"
    
    s  "NOOOOOO!!!"
    
    "Out of nowhere, Soume dashes past the clearing we came through on our way here."  
    "Mamoru turns to him before he can slam Roman to the ground, and drops his body on the ground next to him."  
    "He lays there, barely moving.  He looks as if he is trying to crawl somewhere on using his arms, but his body just doesn’t have the strength."
    
    m  "Oh, you would have to show up and ruin the fun, wouldn’t you?  You know, I am getting rather sick and-HURK"
    
    "A giant tree branch sprouts from the ground and impales Mamoru on the end of it.  He goes flying through the air before connecting with a loud thud against a tree.  He scrambles to his feet."
    
    "Soume is still sprinting at him.  He looks nothing like he usually does.  Irate, crazed, and yelling something that I can’t understand."  
    "Mamoru looks up, and for the first time I witness a look of panic across his face.  He emits a cloud of smoke, and by the time it clear up, he is gone."
    
    "Soume looks around briefly before running over to Roman."
    
    s   "Roman~!  Oh, please Roman be alright!"
    
    r  "Soume, he’s hurt badly.  I don’t…I don’t know if he’s going to make it."
    
    ro  "Urgh…glrgh…ffbt…"
    
    "He’s trying to tell us something, but all that comes out from his mouth are guttural sounds and bubbles of blood."  
    "I get a look at his face, and it looks as if he is missing at least half of his teeth.  I see some of them scattered across the grass."
    
    k  "Soume…how did you find us?"
    
    s  "I was on my way to the store…saw a group of demon hunters.  I-I got here as quick as I could.  Oh, Roman…please pull through."
    
    "Soume is spreading something over Roman.  Some sort of pollen.  The bleeding appears to stop, but the wounds themselves do not heal."
    
    s  "We have to get him back, now."
    
    r  "Here, let me help you."
    
    s  "No!  Riku, I am sorry, but you will only slow us down.  Doctor Kazutaka and yourself, get back to the shrine immediately."  
    s "Follow me as quickly as you can.  I don’t know if there are any more around us."
    
    "Soume picks up Roman and takes us.  I run after him, but he is going faster than I can match even carrying the extra person."  
    "I turn to say something to Kazu, but he isn’t with me.  He’s looking at something in the grass."
    
    r  "Kazu, come on, we don’t have time for you to be classifying new species!"
    
    k  "Hmm…"
    
    "He picks up some sort of electronic piece of equipment and turns it over in his hands.  He stuffs it into his pockets and runs to catch up with me."
    
    r  "What did you pick up there?"
    
    k  "I’m not sure yet.  Riku, after you check on Roman, meet me back in my lab.  It is urgent."
    
    "We both run back towards the rescue.  It would be easy enough to find even if we didn’t know where it was at.  The blood trail from Roman’s body would lead us to it."
    
label kaz28:
    "I’m sitting in Kazu’s lab, shaking.  I just got back from seeing Roman.  He isn’t conscious yet.  Soume told me he should be fine, but the look in his eyes seemed to indicate he wasn’t so sure."
    
    r  "I…I can’t believe this."
    
    k  "Hm?  Oh yes, I hope Roman does pull through.  Once Soume is finished, I shall go take a look myself.  I’m sure once he receives some proper medical attention, he’ll be fine."

    r  "What…what did Mamoru mean…that you used to work for him?"

    r  "Oh…and he made you…uh…"

    k  "It was.  I did…unspeakable things to other Majin.  At their orders.  I…I did some terrible things to a lot of people.  To…Soume."
    
    r  "Huh?  Soume?"
    
    k  "Yes.  My master before Mamoru, he had captured Soume and forced me to experiment on him.  I…tested what temperatures Majin could withstand.  I…I castrated him."
    
    r  "…castrate?"
    
    "I was afraid to know the answer.  I wish I hadn’t even said anything."

    "A look of extreme sadness flashes over his face, and for a second he freezes.  He shakes his head, mumbles something to himself, and then immediately gets back to what he was working on."
    
    k  "That was a long time ago though.  Soume eventually broke out, and my master was killed at the hands of Mamoru."

    "Kazu is working quickly setting up some of his remaining glassware, but he takes this time to smile at me."  
    "I don’t have the strength to smile back.  Roman is nearly dead, and the attack happened somewhere we are supposed to feel safe."
    
    r  "They were…just a half mile away from the rescue.  They have to be closing in on us.  Even if Roman does live…"
    
    k  "All the more reason why we most complete this research at once.  Hm…yes, this might work nicely.  And perhaps some of this…"
    
    "He is running around his lab, pouring some of any chemical he can find into several bowls.  He has set up the same thing we used last time when we were testing his reflexes."
    
    r  "Kazu, don’t take this the wrong way, but I’m not sure if now is the best time for all this.  Like, I just need some time to-"
    
    k  "No!  Riku, there is no other time.  You said it yourself.  They are closing in.  But we can still figure this all out."  
    k "But I need your help!  Please, I can’t do this on my own.  Let Soume worry about Roman for now.  I need you here."
    
    "He looks at me.  His desperation has left.  I don’t know what it is, but the confidence that he lost last week seems to have fully returned to him."
    
    r  "…fine.  Yeah, I can help."

    r  "Heh.  Who knows.  Maybe it will bring us some luck."
    
    k  "Hmph.  Luck is for those who lack skill.  There is no luck in this work; it is merely a silly concept created by the weak to scapegoat their own faults.  No, we-"
